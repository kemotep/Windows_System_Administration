# Windows System Administration
 
This is a GitLab repository of my various Windows Scripts (PowerShell and Batch Files). I plan on including some text resources, links, and other best practices I find for administering Windows.


## Getting Started
TODO
Here is where I will place instructions on how to use this repository. Eventually there will be instructions an explanations for each script, as well as a table of contents.

You should be using script signing when you use PowerShell scripts. Allowing unsigned PowerShell scripts is a security risk. `RemoteSigned` is a recommended Execution policy. Read the Official documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-5.1)

## Built With

[PowerShell](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/)

[VIM](https://www.vim.org/)

[git](https://git-scm.com/)


## Versioning

I plan to use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. As an example this document is on version 2.0
