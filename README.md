# Windows Scripts Repository
 

This is a GitLab repository of my various Windows Scripts (PowerShell and Batch Files). I plan on including some text resources, links, and other best practices I find for administering Windows.

## Table of Contents
TODO: change hyperlinks

## Getting Started
TODO
Here is where I will place instructions on how to use this repository. Eventually there will be instructions an explanations for each script, as well as a table of contents.

You should be using script signing when you use PowerShell scripts. Allowing unsigned PowerShell scripts is a security risk. `RemoteSigned` is a recommended Execution policy. Read the Official documentation [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_execution_policies?view=powershell-5.1)


## Notes

I will also be including my own notes for Windows Management in this repository. I will also include links to resources, guides, documentation, and communities.

  ### [Exchange Management](https://github.com/kemotep/Windows/blob/master/Notes/Exchange%20Management.md)
  
  This is a list of all the Exchange Online commands that I know and example outputs. Very useful for managing Exchange. This list is not comprehensive. I plan to create a script/module that can run all of this from one window.

  ### [Links](https://github.com/kemotep/Windows/blob/master/Notes/Links.md)
  
  Here will be links to resources and communities that I use.
